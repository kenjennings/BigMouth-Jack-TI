BigMouth Jack is originally a VIC-20 program by Jack Salzman written in 1981.

The program was republished by COMPUTE!'s Gazette in Issue 4, October 2025.

I did a simple port to the Atari 8-bit computers' Atari BASIC, with a few enhancements.

The TI version was written and tested on the Classic99 emulator for the TI99/4A V2.2 system.

Since redefining characters is so simple on the TI, I used the character set from the Atari version of the demo. (easy peasy)

Press the Enter key to run through the animation frames of the pumpkin laughing.
(I did not do all the animation mouth shapes that are in the Atari version).
