BigMouth Jack is originally a VIC-20 program by Jack Salzman written in 1981.

The program was republished by COMPUTE!'s Gazette in Issue 4, October 2025.

This is a simple port to the Atari 8-bit computers' Atari BASIC.

This uses Atari's Graphics mode 1 for large color characters to draw the pumpkin on the screen.   Use the joystick button for the controller in port 1 to change pictures/animation frames.
